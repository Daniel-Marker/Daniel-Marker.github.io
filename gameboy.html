                            <h2>What is it?</h2>
                            <p>This project is a framework for making RPGs for the Gameboy. Included is an example game showing off some of the features of the framework.</p>

                            <h2>Who did what?</h2>
                            <p>The library used for music was <a href="https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player">GBT Player</a>. Apart from that library, everything else was done by myself.</p>

                            <h2>When was it worked on?</h2>
                            <p>Work started on the project around March of 2018 and finished around April of 2019</p>

                            <h2>What are the controls?</h2>
                            <p>D-Pad to move. A to interact with things and B to cancel. Start to open the menu.</p>

                            <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                            <p>
                                I think the biggest thing that went right with this project was that I actually finished it.
                                Before this project, I had finished very few projects I had started. However with this, I was able to see it through to the end.
                                Because of this and because of how difficult it was to do, I think this is the project I'm most proud of.
                                <br />
                                Before I started development, one of the main things I had heard about the Gameboy was that the CPU was weak.
                                Because of this, when I was writing code, I would try to optimise for time instead of for space.
                                This caused problems later on, as I made much of the data be uncompressed to make it quicker to access.
                                When I had to allocate memory banks for everything I found that, due to the data being uncompressed, it was difficult to fit everything I needed in.
                                Additionally, planning exactly what data would go in which memory bank was more difficult due to the large size of the data.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Where can I play the game/access the source code?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Both the game and the source code can be found on my github account. Alternatively, you can click
                                <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Marker/Gameboy-RPG-Framework">here</a> to go straight to the github page.
