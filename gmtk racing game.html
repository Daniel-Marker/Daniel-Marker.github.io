                    <h2>What is RC Racing?</h2>
                    <p>
                        RC Racing is a racing game made in Unity. It was made for the 2019 GMTK game jam, where the theme was "only one".
                        I made a racing game in which you control an RC car. However, you have only one battery for the remote.
                        So, you can either move forward and left or forward and right.
                    </p>

                    <h2>When was the game jam?</h2>
                    <p>The game jam took place from the 2nd to the 4th of August 2019</p>

                    <h2>What are the controls?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Use the mouse to drag and drop the battery into the battery slots
                    </p>

                    <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the game jam, one of the things I struggled with was the AI for the opponent.
                        I originally wanted to make the AI send out 3 rays each at 45 degrees to each other. If at the end of the ray, there was the players car or a point off the track,
                        it would turn accordingly. However, I was unable to implement something like this. Due to the time limit, I had to make the AI follow a set path.
                        However, after doing some research a few weeks later, I slightly rewrote the AI. Instead of following a set path,
                        it would randomly pick a point near the path and travel to that instead.<br />
                        I think one of the big things that went right here was my development cycle. As, after coming up with an idea, I was able make a prototype.
                        After making this prototype, I decided that this was a viable option and further developed it.
                        Additionally, I was able to plan things out accurately. Because of this I was able to finish and submit my game roughly an hour early.
                        I was lucky with this, as I was able to avoid the crash the website had later on.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Where can I play the game/access the source code?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both the game and the source code can be found on my github account. Alternatively, you can click
                        <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Marker/RC-Racing" target="_blank">here</a> to go straight to the github page.
